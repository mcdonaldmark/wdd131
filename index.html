            <h3>Utah</h3>
            <img class="image2" src="images/utah.jpg" alt="Mark McDonald" width="350" height="250">
            <p class="alignright">Utah is a landlocked state in the Mountain West subregion of the Western United
                States. It is one of the Four Corners
                states, sharing a border with Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. It also borders Wyoming to the
                northeast, Idaho to the
                north, and Nevada to the west. In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a
                population of just
                over three million, is the 13th largest by area, the 30th most populous, and the 11th least densely
                populated. Urban
                development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the Wasatch Front in the north-central part of the
                state, which
                includes the state capital, Salt Lake City, and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and
                Washington County
                in the southwest, which has approximately 180,000 residents. Most of the western half of Utah lies in
                the Great
                Basin..</p>
